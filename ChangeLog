	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Tagged release-3-2-3 to match the top level directory.

	* Merged with 3.1.9. The next merge should use -j release-3-1-9 -j
	release-3-1. I think the 2000-08-02 log entry is wrong. I don't
	see any 3-1-8 tag in this code. For this merge I used the 3-1-7
	tag assuming that the prior versions were merged OK.

	release-3-1.

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm (command): The ASCII and html form features no
	longer loose port numbers.

	* Added defines that suppress the creation of config.cache files.
	Those files speed up running configure, but they make building the
	sources more complex because those cache files sometimes get into
	the distributions.

	* Updated the config.guess and config.sub files using those found
	in automake-1.3.
