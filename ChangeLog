	* ChangeLog, .project, nph-dods.in: Update

	* dods.rc: removed

2005-05-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* NEWS: Added

	* DODS_Cache.pm, DODS_Dispatch.pm, Makefile.am, acinclude.m4,
	check_perl.sh, common_tests.exp, configure.ac, dods.rc,
	dods_logging.pm, read_config.pm, ud_aclocal.m4: 
	Update for the new build/install.

	* .project: *** empty log message ***

2005-04-18  pwest  <pwest@zoey.opendap.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm:
	setting error code on an error to 1001, was being set to 0

2005-03-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* COPYRIGHT_URI:
	Updated the old URI Copyright; removed clause about requiring credit
	in publications. This was never really intended and is probably
	unenforcable.

2004-10-22  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm:
	fule_uri() --> full_uri() when getting the version info. See bug 821.

2004-10-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* FilterDirHTML.pm:
	Fixed anchor_ref --> anchor_href in one of the debug statments.

	* FilterDirHTML.pm:
	Hacked up the comments so the code is easier to read. Added a note about bug
	755 and bug 814.

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm, FilterDirHTML.pm:
	Added changes from NRL. These address a problem with the directory
	response and files whose type (HDF, netCDF, et c.) are determined using
	a regex that looks at the complete path and not just the filename. The
	problem was that the full path was not used when building the directory
	listing which meant that files that should have been treated as data files
	were not.
	The patches were provided by Brandon Casey <casey@hydrogen.nrlssc.navy.mil>.

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm:
	Incorporated a patch from John Allision that fixes a problem he had with the
	version and .ver responses. See bug 820.

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm:
	Fixed a spelling mistake in one of the error messages.

2004-10-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* FilterDirHTML.pm:
	Replaced $self = {} with $self = HTML::Filter->new as per bug report 813.

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm:
	I removed the single quotes around the options when calling usage as per info
	from Brandon Casey (bug 810).

2004-07-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* ChangeLog, DODS_Dispatch.pm, FilterDirHTML.pm, acinclude.m4, common_tests.exp:
	Merged with release-3-4-8FCS

2004-07-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-8FCS.

2004-07-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* nightly_dods_build.sh: Modified so that CVS is updated only when
	UPDATE_CVS is set to "Yes". This should get things going again in
	the face of the recent CVS break in. Added OPTION_N, other
	changes, see the file's log.  

	* nightly_dods_build.conf.example: Added UPDATE_CVS so that it
	will be on by default. Edits so the example will work with old sh
	implementations. 

	* common_tests.exp: Two changes/fixes: The char-by-char break down
	of how comp and expected output differ is printed on if $verbose
	is >= 3. Also, the second 'fail ...' call has been removed. this
	caused tests to FAIL with $verbose was >=1 even though they really
	passed. 

	* aclocal.m4: Modified the test for librx so it's effectively not
	used. The regex code is now included in libdap++. Fixed a bug in
	the DODS_MAT macro. 

	* FilterDirHTML.pm: Fixed bug 702: HREFed URLs in the return
	document were not quoted. This code worked with most browsers but
	failed for some HTML parsers.

	* Added HTTP response status line and Content-Type header for the
	directory response to DODS_Dispatch.pm.

2004-02-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-2FCS. The next merge should use update
	-j release-3-4-2FCS -j release-3-4

2004-02-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Several fixes to the nightly_build.sh script.

	* Added a test to see if the access and error logs are readable.
	This will work only when this script is used to install the
	servers. I've also added tests in the dods_logging.pm module to
	report to us when the files are not readable. 

	* Added error reporting so we can tell if a site has turned stats
	on but blocked access to the actual log files. 

	* I modified the DODS_MATLAB macro: it was not setting the
	matlab_lib-dir correctly because the wrong test was used when
	initially checking the value of MATLAB_LIB. In fact I cannot see
	hoe MATLAB_LIB can ever be non-zero, but I've left it alone
	because these macros are so inter-woven. 

	* Added information about the .dodsrc configuration file and the AIS.

2004-01-22  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4. The next merge should use update -j
	release-3-4FCS -j release-3-4.

2003-04-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-3-1.

	* An example use of DODS_CONF was added to the
	nightly_dods_build.conf.example. The build script itself was
	modified to send a more useful message. More importantly, A number
	of changed to the build script have been merged into this version.
	The script is now used with just one directory, so multiple builds
	on one host will require multiple copies of the script and its
	configuration file. This is pretty simple to set up in practice.

	* DODS_Cache.pm: now correctly installed.

	* JGOFS server fixes in installServers.

	* Added test for gcc 3 to the DODS_GCC macro (in aclocal.m4).

	* Fixed a bug where URLs that didn't end in a slash but which did
	point to a directory were hosed.

2003-01-23    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Made release 3.3.0. Not merged.

2003-01-22    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Renamed the dods.ini file to dods.rc. Note that this file is
	used to configure servers and is not the same as the .dodsrc file
	used to control client-side use of HTTP and the client-side cache.

	* I changed the source files so that they are clearly covered by
	the GNU Lesser GPL.

2002-12-31    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-10.

2002-06-05    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm: Modified so that usage gets option
	information. See bug 453.

2002-05-21    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* installServers, DODS_Dispatch.pm, nph-dods.in: Added two options
	to the server dispatch and install code: Servers can be registered
	by answering a question in the installServers script. Servers can
	also provide remote access to activity logs. Users must agree to
	this stuff before anything happens. The default is to register the
	server but to not provide access to the activity info.

2002-04-24    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nightly_dods_build.sh (host): Now does not send an email if the
	only problems were things that won't build because configure
	cannot find the required stuff (like Matlab or IDL).

2002-04-23    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* common_tests.exp: Switched back to the compare test...

2002-04-19    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nightly_dods_build.conf.example (MAKE): Added MAKE.

	* common_tests.exp: equal is now the default string comparison op.

2002-04-17    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nightly_dods_build.sh (host): Added time/date stamp to end of build.

2002-04-12    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* nightly_dods_build.sh: Added configuration stuff.

	* dods.ini: Added line for the matlab server.

	* aclocal.m4: Changed dsp root not fround from warning to error.

2002-04-05    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* aclocal.m4 (DODS_MATLAB): Removed ML 4 compat switch.

2002-04-03    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm (rfc822_to_time): Added instrumentation.
	Removed debugging.

	* aclocal.m4: Fixed DODS_FIND_IDL.

2001-12-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm: Added a patch contibuted by Jason Thaxter so
	that servers known by IP addresses work.
	(initialize): Fixed a bug that caused directory names with dots to
	break. 

2001-12-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed two problems in DODS_Dispatch.pm. DODS servers were
	responding to directory URLs that did not end in a slash by saying
	that the URL had a bad character in its extension. That's fixed. I
	also expanded on the formats of time strings the code understands.

2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-8.

	* Fixed the Matlab macro in aclocal.m4.

	* Fixes to DODS_Dispatch.pm (seemingly endless).

2001-10-01  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added check_perl.sh, a simple shell script, to check that
	debugging is really turned off in the perl scripts before we make
	a binary tar!

2001-09-26  Daniel Holloway  <dan@dax.po.gso.uri.edu>

	* Modified DODS_Dispatch.pm, removing regexp for 'jg'
	server which stripped the PATH_INFO variable.  The
	current version of the 'jg' filters (v-3.2.2) now use
	the directory information in the PATH_INFO to support
	multiple object dictionaries at a provider site.  
	Unfortunately, the 'jg' server still requires PATH_INFO
	which is different from all the other servers.

2001-08-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fix from Rob Morris for directory names with `.' in them. The
	call to is_directory() was moved before the the line that uses a
	regex to separate the file's basename from its extension. I then
	fixed this fix by modifying Rob's fix to use PATH_TRANSLATED and
	removed match looking for slashes.

	* I also fixed a problem with the used of sort. Perl was spitting
	out a warning because the ordering function used by sort used a
	variable that was out of scope.

	* Fixed a security problem (Bug 186) where pathnames with shell
	meta characters could make their way to /bin/sh (if they were
	present in pathnames to be decompressed). The shell is still used
	(haven't figured out how to run gzip in the server without
	redirecting stdout) but paths are sanitized. 

2001-07-10  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added an error message return to
	DODS_Cache::decompress_and_cache(); nph-dods checks for the error
	and wraps it in an error response if it's present.

	* Fixed a security hole in DODS_Cache.pm.

2001-06-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-4 -j release-3-2.

2001-06-14  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The directory feature now works with an valid directory name; it
	does not have to end with a slash (/).

2001-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Tagged release-3-2-3 to match the top level directory.

2001-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Tagged release-3-2-3 to match the top level directory.

2000-08-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.9. The next merge should use -j release-3-1-9 -j
	release-3-1. I think the 2000-08-02 log entry is wrong. I don't
	see any 3-1-8 tag in this code. For this merge I used the 3-1-7
	tag assuming that the prior versions were merged OK.

2000-08-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.8. The next merge should use -j release-3-18 -j
	release-3-1.

2000-06-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.7 (skipped 3.1.6) The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-7 -j -release-3-1.

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: The next merge should use -j release-3-1-5 -j
	release-3-1. 

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: cvs update -j release-3-1, The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1

2000-05-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm (command): The ASCII and html form features no
	longer loose port numbers.

1998-10-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added defines that suppress the creation of config.cache files.
	Those files speed up running configure, but they make building the
	sources more complex because those cache files sometimes get into
	the distributions.

	* Updated the config.guess and config.sub files using those found
	in automake-1.3.
