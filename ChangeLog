	* Modified DODS_Dispatch.pm, removing regexp for 'jg'
	server which stripped the PATH_INFO variable.  The
	current version of the 'jg' filters (v-3.2.2) now use
	the directory information in the PATH_INFO to support
	multiple object dictionaries at a provider site.  
	Unfortunately, the 'jg' server still requires PATH_INFO
	which is different from all the other servers.

	* Fix from Rob Morris for directory names with `.' in them. The
	call to is_directory() was moved before the the line that uses a
	regex to separate the file's basename from its extension. I then
	fixed this fix by modifying Rob's fix to use PATH_TRANSLATED and
	removed match looking for slashes.

	* I also fixed a problem with the used of sort. Perl was spitting
	out a warning because the ordering function used by sort used a
	variable that was out of scope.

	* Fixed a security problem (Bug 186) where pathnames with shell
	meta characters could make their way to /bin/sh (if they were
	present in pathnames to be decompressed). The shell is still used
	(haven't figured out how to run gzip in the server without
	redirecting stdout) but paths are sanitized. 

2001-07-10  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added an error message return to
	DODS_Cache::decompress_and_cache(); nph-dods checks for the error
	and wraps it in an error response if it's present.

	* Fixed a security hole in DODS_Cache.pm.

2001-06-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-4 -j release-3-2.

2001-06-14  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The directory feature now works with an valid directory name; it
	does not have to end with a slash (/).

2001-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Tagged release-3-2-3 to match the top level directory.

2001-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Tagged release-3-2-3 to match the top level directory.

2000-08-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.9. The next merge should use -j release-3-1-9 -j
	release-3-1. I think the 2000-08-02 log entry is wrong. I don't
	see any 3-1-8 tag in this code. For this merge I used the 3-1-7
	tag assuming that the prior versions were merged OK.

2000-08-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.8. The next merge should use -j release-3-18 -j
	release-3-1.

2000-06-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.7 (skipped 3.1.6) The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-7 -j -release-3-1.

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: The next merge should use -j release-3-1-5 -j
	release-3-1. 

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: cvs update -j release-3-1, The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1

2000-05-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* DODS_Dispatch.pm (command): The ASCII and html form features no
	longer loose port numbers.

1998-10-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added defines that suppress the creation of config.cache files.
	Those files speed up running configure, but they make building the
	sources more complex because those cache files sometimes get into
	the distributions.

	* Updated the config.guess and config.sub files using those found
	in automake-1.3.
