This is the base software for the OPeNDAP data server. It uses the
CGI 1.1 protocol and requires Apache or a similar web daemon. 

The software here includes three C++ programs which are installed in
<prefix>/sbin and a collection of Perl software install in
<prefix>/share/dap-server. Finally, the Perl script nph-dods, it's
configuration file dap-server.rc and the HTML interface help file
dods_form_help.html are also here. These last three files are
installed in the HTTP daemon's CGI binaries directory (you can use the
default cgi-bin or set up a new one). Thus the bulk of the fles used
to process a DAP request are not actually in the CGI directory.
