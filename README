See the Install-servers file for information about installing NVODS/OPeNDAP
servers. 

This directory contains software used by DODS during the build process and at
runtime. Software that may be useful to developers working on new
client-libraries or data servers is also kept here. Lastly, information about
the project that fits nowhere else, such as the copyright statement for the
core and sample software is here.

Scripts used during the build:

install-sh: The GNU replacement for `install'. Presence of this script
guarantees that configure will be able to find a compatible installation
utility when it is creating the Makefiles.

depend.sh: This is a script which replaces makedepend. It requires gcc, but
so does the rest of DODS (at least in principle), so that should not matter. 

config.{sub, guess}: Guess the host vendor, hardware and operating system
combination. Used by configure when building the Makefiles.

aclocal.m4: Used by autoconf when building the configure scripts from the
configure.in files. Users should never have to mess with this, but people
writing configure.in files will find it handy.
