This directory contains software used by developers of DODS as well as
software used during configuration of the source code. In addition to
templates, scripts and copies of the software licenses under which DODS is
distributed, this directory may also contain software which is created during
the build process and deemed to be useful to people developing DODS compliant
software.

Several scripts are kept in this directory.

install-sh: The GNU replacement for `install'. Presence of this script
guarantees that configure will be able to find a compatible installation
utility when it is creating the Makefiles.

localize.sh: This script can be used to create `local' versions of an API
given the names of all the external symbols in an implementation of that
API. The script renames all the external symbols so that the `localized'
library can be linked with a DODS library which contains the APIs original
external symbols. This is a pretty primitive way to do things -- if you know
of a better way, please tell us!

depend.sh: This is a script which replaces makedepend. It requires gcc, but
so does the rest of DODS (at least in principle), so that should not matter. 

There are several template files also kept in this directory (Each of these
templates must be customized to be useful; these templates provide a unified
starting point):

Makefile.in: This is the prototypical Makefile for DODS.

configure.in: ...and this is the prototypical autoconf file. DODS uses GNU's
autoconf to build Makefiles from Makefile.ins.  The scripts used to create
the Makefiles are built by autoconf from the configure.in files.

Also in this directory:

COPYING: The GNU software license. This covers all the DODS software from
URI/MIT *not* covered by the GNU Library copyright.

COPYING.LIB-2.0: The GNU Library software copyright. All the DODS libraries
developed at URI/MIT are covered by this copyright.
