We're pleased to announce the first release of the version 3.5 data server.
This server contains a number of bug fixes along with some significant 
improvements in the build and install process. The server's design changes
improve security and simplify configuring a server for login access.

The version 3.5 server has a very different installation layout than previous
versions. Now only the nph-dods CGI script and its configuration file are
installed in a CGI bin directory. The other files are installed in
/usr/local/share/dap-server and /usr/local/bin.

It's no longer a requirement that data be stored under the WWW daemon's
DocumentRoot. See the section about the configuration parameter 'data_root'
in the dap-server README file.

This version of the server contains alpha-level support for DAP responses
encoded in XML instead of the 'curly brace' notation used in the past. The
newest version of libdap (3.5.3) also supports reading. We would like to
hear any comments about the design you have.

The ntcdf handler is now a standalone software package and does not include
netCDF Client Library software. This simplifies the build considerably.

We will be supplying RPM and Mac OS/X packages when binary builds are ready.

Some significant bugs have been fixed in the hdf4 handler; see the Trac 
Server 3.5 milestone for the complete details.
