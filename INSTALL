BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

  To build the OPeNDAP Server Base Software, follow these steps:

  0. Please skim REQUIREMENTS and NOTES sections of this file
     before reporting problems. Thanks.

  1. Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have
     to type `sh configure'.

  2. Type `make' to build the software, `make check' to test the
     software.  You must have the GNU automated testing software DejaGNU and
     the CppUnit library to run all the tests. If you have neither, then the
     tests won't yield useful results.

  3. Type `make install' to install the software. The software consists of
     soe Perl modules and three compile programs written in C++. The Perl
     software, along with the server's configuration file and a help file,
     will be isntall in /usr/local/share/dap-server, and the C++ programs will
     install in /usr/local/sbin. If you'd like to change the installation
     prefex from its default of /usr/local, use the --prefix option of
     configure. See ./configure --help for more information.

  4. See the file README for inportant information about configuation of the
     server. Without those extra steps, the server will not work!

REQUIREMENTS

  o The Server Base Software uses libdap 3.5.2 or greater. You must install
    that software. See http://www.opendap.org/download/.

  o You will need the perl package HTML::Parser installed. Use cpan ot rpm to
    install the package:
	    
	perl -MCPAN -e shell
	install HTML::Parser

    or

	force install HTML::Parser

    In somce cases the a few of the tests for the module may fail and cpan
    will only install the software if you use the 'force' option.

    To install using RPM, install the package per-HTML-Parser.

  o You should have gcc/g++ 2.95.x or greater. You'll also need to get the
    stdc++ library that matches the compiler (whatever version). In most
    cases it's part of the compiler. NB: gcc 2.8.x and earlier *won't* build
    the software. We're working on modifying the software so that it will
    build with a variety of compilers. As of 07/07/05 we have built the code
    using Microsoft's Visual C++ 6.0 and GNU gcc/++ 3.2.1, 3.3, 3.4 and 4.0
    beta.

  o You will need the GNU auto tools (autoconf 2.57 and its associated
    programs) if you're building from SVN or need/want to hack the
    configure.ac, acinclude.m4, et c., files. Use autoreconf to rebuild
    configure; if you call autoconf directly the aclocal.m4 file won't get
    built from acinclude.m4 correctly.

NOTES

  o If you are building on a new platform (one for which we don't supply
    binaries), please run the tests and tell us about any failures. To do a
    really complete job of this you'll need to get the GNU test system called
    DejaGNU and CppUnit. It is very simple to install these and we're very
    willing to help, so don't be shy!
