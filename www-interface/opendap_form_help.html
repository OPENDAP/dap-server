<dt><a name="data_url"><h3>Data URL</h3></a>
<dd>This is the URL that specifies the data. You may edit this by hand adding
a DODS constraint expression to the end of the URL (see the <a
href="http://dods.gso.uri.edu/DODS">DODS user's guide</a> for information on
constraint expressions) or by clicking on one or more of the variables listed
under `Data variables'.

<dt><a name="disposition"><h3>Disposition</h3></a> <dd>The <em>Get ASCII</em>
button retrieves data encoded in ASCII from the server. These data are
displayed in a new browser window; use the File menu of that window to save
the data. The presentation format is designed to be simple to import into a
spreadsheet program.<p>

The <em>Get Binary</em> button is used to retrieve a binary DODS data object
from the server. Read/decode this object using one of the DODS client
programs such as geturl or loaddods (Note: loaddods cannot currently decode
these files, but a new version to be released soon will be able to).<p>

The button labeled `Send to Program' causes the data to be sent directly to
the <tt>loaddods</tt> extension command (currently this works only for Matlab
but we will support IDL soon). Read the documentation for that DODS client to
properly configure it. Using this button, you may import data values directly
into Matlab. Be aware that some limitations exist on the types of data that
you may import and this interface does not try to enforce those limitations
(because they don't apply to the other disposition options). Specifically,
arrays must be no more than two dimensions when working with Matlab 4. To
read data from an array with more than two dimension, project one or more
dimensions so that they contain only a single element. For example, given a
the dimensional array <tt>U</tt> a constraint that would let you read this
into Matlab would be: <tt>U[0:0][0:9][0:9]</tt>. Note that the first
dimension has been reduced to a single element by selecting index zero.

<dt><a name="global_attributes"><h3>Global attributes</h3></a> 
<dd>contain information about the dataset as a whole. Most datasets contain
this type of information, but some do not.

<dt><a name="variable_attributes"><h3>Variable attributes</h3></a> 
<dd>contain specific information about each variable in the dataset.

<dt><a name="dataset_variables"><h3>Dataset Variables</h3></a> <dd>This list
shows each variable contained in this data. clicking the checkbox to the left
of one or more of these variables causes it/them to be added to the current
projection of this dataset. When you click on one of the `Disposition'
button, data in those variables will be retrieved.
