To build the WWW interface component of the dods servers, type:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

The interface does not yet have a testsuite.

The install target copies the filter `www_int' to the DODS_ROOT/etc
directory. If this directory is not one of your CGI binary directories, then
the filter must be copied to such a directory. Look in your web server's
configuration files or ask your system administrator if you don't know the
correct directory.
