Install the WWW Interface DODS Server component.

BUILDING THE SOFTWARE
REQUIREMENTS
NOTES

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUILDING THE SOFTWARE

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure.'

2a) Type `make' to build the software.

3a) Install the www interface server component in DODS_ROOT/etc by running
    `make install.'

REQUIREMENTS

  o You need to have the DAP library and at least libwww, libz and librx from
    the third-party packages installed before building this software.

NOTES

  o If the build fails because make reports that it does not know how to make
    a particular file, try runing `make depend' to rebuild the Makefile's
    dependencies.

  o DEBUGGING AIDS

    - The DODS API includes the following debugging aids that may be of help
      to you in developing new DODS applications.

    - DBG: simple program instrumentation -- see the file debug.h in
      $DODS_ROOT/include for more information

    - DBG2: more elaborate program instrumentation -- by convention this is
      used for output that is half a page or more, while DEBUG is used for
      single line output.

    - dbnew: include -ldbnew and -lefence when linking. libdbnew.a contains
      overloaded versions of new, new[] delete and delete[]. It also contains
      code to `walk the malloc chain' and simple checks for out-of-bounds
      errors.

    - efence: a freely available bounds checker for dynamically allocated
      memory. When used with dbnew, efence must be set to 8-byte alignment.
      efence will find all over- or under-writes of dynamically allocated
      memory, but only works on some machines.

    - To build with program instrumentation use `--enable-debug=<level>'
      where <level> is 1 or 2.

    - By default, both debug and dbnew are *not* enabled. Thus, if you want
      to build a straight version of the libraries and test code, use
      `./configure'. If you want the extra features, use:

      ./configure --enable-dbnew --enable-debug=2
