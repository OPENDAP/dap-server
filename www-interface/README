The www_int program is a simple WWW form-type interface for DODS datasets.
It can be run as a CGI using the dods_form script (which in turn runs the
www_int program). 

Here are some sample URLs:

http://www.dods.org/test/dods_form?url=http://www.dods.org/test/nph-nc/data/nc/fnoc1.nc
http://www.dods.org/test/dods_form?url=http://www.dods.org/test/nph-nc/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc
http://www.dods.org/test/dods_form?url=http://www.dods.org/etc/nph-ff/data/ff/test1.dat
http://www.dods.org/test/dods_form?url=http://www.dods.org/etc/nph-hdf/data/hdf/S2000415.HDF 

To make dods_form work you must give it the dataset URL as a parameter. So,
to look at other datasets you should be able to substitute that dataset's URL
for the `url' parameter in the above URLS.

However, the www_int program can only work with files - datasets that are
referred to using a single URL. To look at multi-file datasets, use the CGI
dods_dir. This CGI emulates the browse directory page interface where to
enter a subdirectory users click on the subdirectory's name to enter. To use
dods_dir you must give it both the data's URL (which does not contain the
DODS server but rather just points to the place n the web server where the
data files live) *and* the URL of that data's server. Even though both URLs
contain the machine name the data and it server must be on the machine (i.e.,
there is some redundancy here).

Here are some sample URLs for the dods_dir CGI:

http://www.dods.org/test/dods_dir?url=http://dods.gso.uri.edu/avhrr/&server=http://dods.gso.uri.edu/cgi-bin/nph-dsp/

To run this with other multi-file datasets, plug in the data and server URLS.
Note that the server URL is `http://<machine>/<cgi-bin>/<script>' (NB: I use
<cgi-bin> == `etc' for the release servers and ... == `test' for the
development servers, most places use `cgi-bin'). The `url' parameter is the
URL to the *data*. This is the top of the data's tree under the web server's
document root directory.
