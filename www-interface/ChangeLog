2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-5.

	* www_int now returns 1 on error. This fixes www_int's role in bug
	300. 

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.2.4. The next merge should use release-3-2-4 -j
	release-3-2. 

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Removed the `Send to Program' button and its help text. This
	fixes the `bug' that confuses users; they see this but it's too
	hard to set up the programs and hack netscape to get it to work.

	* Fixed two problems: 1) Variable names in the JavaScript code
	sometimes contained spaces since they were made using the
	dataset's variable name. The names are now filtered through id2www
	and esc2underscore. 2) The CE sometimes contained spaces, again,
	because dataset variable names were used to build the CE. I
	filtered the names with id2www_ce before passing them to the
	JavaScript code. 

2001-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

2001-07-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* WWWOutput.cc (name_for_js_code): Changed the prefix applied to
	variable names (which is done to reduce/eliminate name collisions
	between the HTML page, the dataset and JavaScript). The prefix
	used to be `dods_' and now it's `org_dods_dcz<pid>.' This should
	fix bug #228.

2001-06-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-2. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-2 -j release-3-2.

2001-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2. Tagged release-3-2-1. The next merge
	should use -j release-3-2-1 -j release-3-2.

	* Removed javascript.h from CVS since it is a generated file.

	* Fixed a bug in the JavaScript code. Now the name of the JS
	variables are prefixed by `dods_'. This means that DODS variables
	whose names are also reserved words in JS work break the JS code.

	* Add DODS_XTRALIBS.

	* Moved Logs to the end of each file.

	* Changed the JavaScript template processing.

	* Fixes for exception-based error reporting.

	* Merged changes from release-3-1. There was a goof and a bunch of the
	changes never made it to the branch. I merged the entire branch.
	There maybe problems still...

	* Added COPYRIGHT statements.

2000-10-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added a config_www_int.h(.in) header. config_dap.h is no longer
	used anywhere.

	* CVS Logs are now at the end of files.

	* www_int now catches exceptions thrown by the dap++ library.

	* Changed the read() member function to match the new definition
	in the dap.

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: cvs update -j release-3-1-1 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge should use -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1

1999-11-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The help page is now stored at Unidata.

	* Fixed IE5 bugs in the JavaScript code.
