	* Merged with release-3-2. Tagged release-3-2-1. The next merge
	should use -j release-3-2-1 -j release-3-2.

	* Removed javascript.h from CVS since it is a generated file.

	* Fixed a bug in the JavaScript code. Now the name of the JS
	variables are prefixed by `dods_'. This means that DODS variables
	whose names are also reserved words in JS work break the JS code.

	* Add DODS_XTRALIBS.

	* Moved Logs to the end of each file.

	* Changed the JavaScript template processing.

	* Fixes for exception-based error reporting.

	* Merged changes from release-3-1. There was a goof and a bunch of the
	changes never made it to the branch. I merged the entire branch.
	There maybe problems still...

	* Added COPYRIGHT statements.

	* CVS Logs are now at the end of files.

	* www_int now catches exceptions thrown by the dap++ library.

	* Changed the read() member function to match the new definition
	in the dap.
