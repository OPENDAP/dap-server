# The DODS_STATISTICS file is used to configure remote access to your
# server's operational information. If you don't want this to be enabled, do
# nothing. By default this is disabled. If you are willing to turn this on
# (and we, the DODS/NVODS project, appreciate it very much) you can either
# rename this file to 'DODS_STATISTICS' and edit the following or use the
# installServers script answering the questions about server registration and
# remote access to the log files. Note: even though the server reads the
# access_log and error_log, it only sends back those lines from the log that
# provide information about the DODS/NVODS server's operation.
#
# Where are the access_log and error_log files for this httpd? 
access_log /var/log/httpd/access_log
error_log /var/log/httpd/error_log

# What names are used to refer to this machine? This is used to ensure that
# only this machine and the machines at DODS/NVODS HQ can use this feature.
# The names should be separated by a vertical bar and should not contain
# spaces. 
machine_names localhost|zanzibar.dods.org
