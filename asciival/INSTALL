   ./configure
   make
   make install

   make check

Note that you should do this after first building the core parts of the DODS
system, specifically the third-party softwre packages and the core C++ class
library. See the generall documentation files for DODS and/or the README and
INSTALL files in $(DODS_ROOT)/packages and $(DODS_ROOT)/src/dap.
