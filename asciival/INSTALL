To build and install asciival, type:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

To run the tests, type:

   make check

Note that you should build this only after first building the core parts of
the DODS system, specifically the third-party software packages and the core
C++ class library. See the general documentation files for DODS and/or the
README and INSTALL files in $(DODS_ROOT)/packages and $(DODS_ROOT)/src/dap
for information on building those parts of the system.

Note that asciival can be used both as a client and as part of a DODS server.
As a DODS server component it is used to produce an ASCII rendering of binary
data. For server versions 3.x and higher, it is a required component and thus
should be stored in the same directory with the other server components.

When used as a client, asciival can be run just like any other command line
utility.
