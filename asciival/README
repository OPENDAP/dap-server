There are four executables used in the DODS-Matlab interface:

1) loaddods; a mex program run by Matlab. This program must be accessible to
Matlab. It can be placed in either a user's directory from scripts and
extensions or in a system-wide directory.
2) writeval; dereferences a DODS URL and returns a binary stream of data.
This can be installed anywhere on the system, but its path is hard coded into
the loaddods program so unless you want to modify the loaddods source code it
should be placed in the same directory as loaddods.
3) urlqueue; a helper application for Netscape (or other WWW browser) which
passes information from a browser to another program such as loaddods.
4) posturl; Users do not need to have this on their system. It is included
here for completeness. However, if users want to write their own HTML forms
for building URLs then they can install and use their own copy of posturl and
make a completely self contained system.
