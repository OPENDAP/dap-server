The following provides background technical information on the design of
asciival. For installation information, see the file INSTALL

ASCIIVAL: The program asciival is a filter that can function as both a client
and a server filter program. The asciival program can read data from a URL, a
local filename or from standard input. The program prints to standard output
an ASCII version of the data where columns are separated by commas and rows
separated by newlines. Users can request data from serves in ASCII form using
the suffix .ascii or .asc in a DODS URL. To see how the asciival program is
used on the server side, look at the DODS_Dispatch.pm Perl module.

James Gallagher 10/4/96

The asciival program has been changed to match the DAP ASCII description in
the draft DAP specification (see the DODS Project web site). The program can
now process many more datasets than before.
