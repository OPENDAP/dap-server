There are four executables used in the DODS-Matlab interface. The loaddods
program is a mex program run by Matlab. It in turn calls writeval which
dereferences a DODS URL and returns a binary stream of data. The programs
urlqueue and posturl are part of the Netscape GUI which makes up the
interface for choosing variables and placing constraints on those variables.
urlqueue is a `helper application' which should be listed in either the
system of user's mailcap or .mailcap file. The executable itself can reside
anywhere but we suggest putting it in $(DODS_ROOT)/etc or a directory users
include in their PATH environment variable.
