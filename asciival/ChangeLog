	* Change: loaddods now looks along the user's PATH and in
	DODS_ROOT/etc for writeval. 

	* Change: writeval is now installed in DODS_ROOT/etc (it is a
	`helper' program). 

	* Added include of <sys/msg.h> for lunix.

	* Fixed a bug where fseek() failed to advance beyond a newline
	character when the data transfer size was an integral power of
	two. I fixed the bug by removing all calls to fseek() and using
	fgets() instead. I also removed all calls to fscanf() and replaced
	them with calls to fgets() followed by sscanf() since that made
	looking at the text information read by loaddods simpler.

	* Modified the output stream of writeval so that it is simpler for
	loaddods to parse. This was done during the coarse of
	finding/fixing a particularly nasty bug in loaddods - I've left
	the changes in place because they don't slow the system down and
	will simplify finding problems in the future.

	* Added fix to helper program `writeval' so that error messages
	returned from servers do not result in core dumps.

	* Added option switch so users can use the fullnames option.

	* Changed the way the catenate option works so that variables will
	not be catenated unless that's what users want.

	* Fixed loaddods help file: added examples, corrected examples,
	hopefully fixed typos.

	* Added vector/matrix catenation. If two or more urls (given using
	the multi-url option of loaddods) retrieve the same variable,
	those values are catenated to the same variable name. So, if one
	URL retrieves a 3 column 5 row array and a second URL gets a 3
	column 7 row array of the same name, loaddods will intern a single
	3 column 12 row array. Note that this is a loaddods feature -
	writeval knows nothing of this.

	* Changed the way writeval handles translation of String values to
	Float64. If the -f switch is given, all string values will be
	translated to float. First the software checks to see if the
	string is a lat/lon value of the form dddmmssh. If so it is
	translated into a +/- real number (with fractional degrees). If
	not, then strtod() is used to translate the string to a double. If
	that fails then NaN is output. Note that this is only true when
	the -f option is given; without the option strings are just
	strings. This introduces a bug in that with the -f option all
	strings that don't translate to floats become NaN.

	* Fixed many bugs - see the file `TODO' in this directory.

	* Fixed situation where strange characters in identifiers confused
	Matlab. Non-alphanumerics are turned into underscores.

Mon Dec 23 11:31:48 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed a nasty bug in the do_array function where single
	dimension arrays were sometimes created as two dimension arrays.
	The errant 2D arrays would be huge (billions and billions...) and
	cause Matlab to complain about not having enough memory.
